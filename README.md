# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles managed with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/). It's designed to work across multiple environments (macOS and Linux) and contexts (personal and work machines).

## Structure

- `dot_config/` - Configuration files that will be placed in ~/.config
- `environments/` - Environment-specific configuration data
  - `darwin/` - macOS specific settings
  - `linux/` - Linux specific settings
  - `personal.toml` - Settings for personal machines
  - `work.toml` - Settings for work machines
- `output/` - Generated by the testing script, contains rendered templates

## Templates

Templates use chezmoi's templating system to conditionally include content based on the operating system and machine type. Key variables used:

- `.chezmoi.os` - Operating system ("darwin" or "linux")
- `.work_machine` - Boolean indicating if this is a work machine

## Usage

To apply these dotfiles to a new machine:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply kevinnly
```

To update from the repository:

```bash
chezmoi update
```
